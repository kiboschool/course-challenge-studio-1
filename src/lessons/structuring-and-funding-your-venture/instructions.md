# Assignment Instructions

---

Your assignment for this week is to develop a simple marketing plan for the venture you are building in this course. The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with the essential components of a marketing strategy and apply them to your own business idea.

You will complete two main tasks:

**Task 1 - Analysis of Competitive Landscape:**
- **Research**: Conduct thorough research to understand the existing alternatives or substitutes that your potential customers currently use.
- **Description**: Identify and analyze your top 2-3 competitors. Consider factors such as market share, product/service offerings, pricing strategy, target audience, and marketing tactics.
- **Your Competitive Advantage**: Clearly articulate the unique selling points or differentiating factors of your venture compared to your competitors. This could include features, quality, pricing, customer service, brand reputation, or any other aspect that sets you apart.

**Task 2 - Your Marketing Strategy:**
- Provide a concise overview of your overall marketing approach. This should include your marketing objectives and the overall message you aim to convey to your target audience.
- List the key marketing channels (i.e., traction channels) you plan to leverage to reach your target market. These could include digital channels (e.g., social media, email marketing, search engine optimization), traditional channels (e.g., print advertising, direct mail), or any other relevant avenues. You can revisit the lesson on [Understanding Traction Channels](https://lms.kibo.school/course/kc005_apr_2024/gaining_traction/understanding_traction_channels) for a refresher of the different options at your disposal.
- For each marketing channel, briefly explain why you have chosen to use it and how you plan to execute your strategy effectively. Consider factors such as audience demographics, reach, cost-effectiveness, and alignment with your overall marketing goals.
