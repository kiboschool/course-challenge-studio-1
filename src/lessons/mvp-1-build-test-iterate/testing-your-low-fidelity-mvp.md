Here are the key takeaways from this video:

There are four loosely defined circles of feedback:
- **First Circle**: This includes the product team and others within your team or company. They are readily available but too close to the project to give accurate feedback as users. They are ideal for reviewing low-fidelity prototypes.
- **Second Circle**: Subject matter experts who know about the market but are not directly working on the product. 
- **Third Circle**: Your target users, who can give great feedback on prototypes that are sufficiently developed for meaningful interaction. 
- **Fourth Circle**: This circle includes your customers' customers.

It's essential to test your MVP with all four circles of feedback to ensure a well-rounded evaluation of your product. This approach helps in identifying different perspectives and improving the product accordingly.

## Checking-In with the EduBridge Team

As the EduBridge team reaches the crucial stage of testing their MVP, they strategically plan to engage the four circles of feedback to ensure comprehensive and actionable insights.

**First Circle: Internal Review**

They kick off their testing within the confines of their own team. Each team member took turns navigating through the low-fidelity prototype, pointing out potential improvements, and discussing functionalities that could enhance user experience. Their familiarity with the project's objectives allowed for a focused review of technical aspects and overall coherence with the mission. This internal session, though limited in providing user-centric feedback, was crucial in preparing the MVP for broader scrutiny.

**Second Circle: Expert Insights**

Next, the team reached out to a group of subject matter experts, including educators, tech developers specialized in educational software, and NGO workers in the education sector. They organized a series of virtual meetings, during which they presented their low-fidelity MVP. These experts, equipped with knowledge about the market and educational needs, offered insights into usability, content relevance, and scalability. Their feedback prompted the team to refine certain features and reconsider some of their initial assumptions about user needs.

**Third Circle: Target Market Testing**

With a more polished low-fidelity MVP in hand, the EduBridge team moved to engage their most critical audience: their target users. They conducted a series of user testing sessions with students and teachers in various schools, focusing on remote areas. The team observed as participants interacted with their MVP, noting their behaviors, questions, and any difficulties they encountered. This direct feedback from actual users was invaluable, highlighting what truly mattered to their core audience and what needed to be reworked or enhanced for better engagement and effectiveness.

**Fourth Circle: Extended User Feedback**

Finally, the team sought feedback from an often overlooked group: their customers' customers. This involved reaching out to parents and community members who, while not direct users, were crucial stakeholders in the educational ecosystem. Through community forums and feedback sessions, the EduBridge team gathered insights into the broader impact and relevance of their platform.

ðŸ’¡ Early in the Anchor development process, many of you were invited to take part in user interviews, where members of Kibo's Anchor team gave you access to a low-fidelity demo of the platform and observed your interactions and questions. This is a great example of the Third Circle Feedback. Prior to those interviews, the team had already done similar testing with Kibo staff members and instructor (First Circle), and other education and technology experts (Second Circle).
