Creating an MVP isn't a one-size-fits-all process. Depending on your venture goals, solution, and available resources, you have various MVP options to choose from. Understanding these options is key as you turn your idea into a real product that people can useâ€”and maybe even pay for!

In this section, you will learn about different types of MVPs. We'll explain each type using videos and show how they work, making it easy to follow. By the end, you'll have a good sense of which MVP could best suit your solution.

## Categories of MVP: Low and High Fidelity

From this video, we learn that there are two categories of MVPs:

- **Low-fidelity**: The simplest form of your MVP that tests core ideas without having all the details and functionalities.
- **High-fidelity**: A more polished experience that tests the user interface, user experience, and user engagement. 

You might remember these terms from your Product Management and Design (PMD) class. Right now, we're focusing on the simple, low-fidelity MVP. Later in the course, you will explore more about high-fidelity MVPs.

### Low-Fidelity MVP

From your PMD class, you learned about a similar concept of low-fidelity prototypes. In that course, we shared that low-fidelity prototypes are best used in the early stages of the design process when many ideas are still up in the air and experimentation is still taking place. They allow us to make changes to ideas and designs easily and quickly.

In a similar way, a low-fidelity MVP is a basic version of a product designed with minimal features and functionality. The term "low-fidelity" refers to the simplicity of this early-stage prototype. 

**Key Characteristics of Low-Fidelity MVPs:**

1. **Basic Features:** Stripping away complexity, a low-fidelity MVP includes only fundamental features.
2. **Limited Functionality:** It performs a singular function, allowing for easy adjustments.
3. **Rapid Development:** Developed swiftly, with a recommended timeline of no more than a week.
4. **No-Code/Low-Code Approach:** Initial development utilizes no-code or low code tools, ensuring agility.

**When to Use a Low-Fidelity MVP:**

- **Idea Validation:** Confirm the viability of your concept.
- **Quick User Feedback:** Gather insights rapidly from potential users.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Minimize initial development costs.
- **Quick Iteration:** Facilitate swift adjustments based on feedback.
- **Risk Minimization:** Test and refine without significant investment.

**Examples of Low-Fidelity MVPs**

1. **Landing Page MVP:** A landing page MVP is a simplified web page that showcases the core idea or product, often used to measure interest, collect leads, and assess user engagement.
2. **Slide Deck/Mockup/Presentation MVP:** This MVP involves creating a visual presentation, like a slide deck or mockup, to convey the product concept or idea, facilitating communication and feedback.
3. **Blog MVP:** A blog MVP entails publishing initial thoughts, concepts, or information related to a product to engage potential users, gather feedback, and build an audience.
4. **Forums/Communities MVP:** In this MVP, you participate in or create forums and communities relevant to your product, interacting directly with potential users to understand their needs, concerns, and preferences.
5. **Surveys/Questionnaires MVP:** A surveys/questionnaires MVP involves creating and distributing targeted surveys to gather specific feedback, opinions, and data from a potential user base.
6. **Explainer Videos MVP:** This MVP utilizes short videos to explain the core features and benefits of a product, providing a visual representation to help users understand the concept.
7. **Advertising Campaign MVP:** An advertising campaign MVP involves running targeted ads to gauge market response, measure click-through rates, and assess the overall interest in a product or idea.
8. **Crowdfunding Campaign MVP:** This MVP utilizes crowdfunding platforms to present a product idea to the public, validate interest, and secure initial financial support based on backers' pledges. 
9. **Idea Spotting Networks MVP:** Idea spotting networks involve leveraging platforms where diverse perspectives provide feedback on a product or idea, helping refine concepts through collaborative insights and discussions.
