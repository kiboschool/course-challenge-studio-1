# Assignment Instructions

---

This week's assignment will require you to compile an iteration report that discusses your learnings and product imporvements over the last two weeks of product testing and iteration. 

The goals of the iteration process are to:
- Get feedback from your users 
- Synthesize and consider what you have learned from that feedback
- Determine how to iterate for the next version(s) of your product

This iteration report is a way for you to document your iteration process.

To accomplish this, your team needs to carry out the following steps:
- As of last week, you should have planned and launched your product to users. If you have not carried out this step yet, make sure you do so as soon as possible.
- Once your product has been launched, you need to conduct interviews with at least 5 people who have used the MVP.
- Finally, you need to gather and summarize your usage data and learnings in the iteration report

This iteration process will take time, so make sure you distribute the workload across all team members and start your user interviews early.
