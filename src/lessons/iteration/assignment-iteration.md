# Assignment - Iteration Report

The iteration report is the deliverable that synthesizes the launch, testing, and iteration processes that you have been carrying out over the last few weeks.

You can copy the following template to ensure that you don't miss out on any required sections of the report. [Iteration Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owpfdJi4vTwvqdXQ_FAUEBnQtQzKzEkj6ruIld6c8gY/template/preview)

If you don't want to use the given template, just ensure that the report includes the following sections:

- **Background**: Write a paragraph summarizing your venture.
- **MVP**: Discuss the features of your MVP, the platform(s) you launched on, etc. Please also include a link to the MVP.
- **Product Usage Summary**: Summarize the key data on the overall product usage post-launch.
- **Users**: Give a summary of the participants in your user interviews, as well as their usage of your product.
