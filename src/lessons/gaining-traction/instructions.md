# Assignment Instructions

---

In this week's assignment, you and your team will design a revenue model for the venture you are building. A revenue model defines how your business will generate income and is essential for demonstrating the feasibility and sustainability of your venture to potential investors and stakeholders. Through thoughtful consideration of your target market, value proposition, and competitive landscape, you will craft a revenue model that aligns with your venture's goals and maximizes its growth potential.

To create your revenue model, your team should go through the following steps (Remember to review the revenue model guidance in this week's [Introduction to Revenue Modeling](https://lms.kibo.school/course/kc005_apr_2024/gaining_traction/introduction_to_revenue_modeling) lesson):

- Evaluate 2 - 4 potential revenue streams using the [Revenue Stream Comparison template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fEN9IjPuXnNTvaWGQq6iTVmxz906e5EcYAQX4THbjAg/template/preview).
Select a revenue stream or combination of streams that best aligns with your venture's characteristics and market dynamics. Consider your pricing strategies and customer payment methods.
- Once you have a good sense of your revenue model/streams, your team should describe your revenue model in a consolidated report. This report should include:  
  - An introduction
  - Overview of your target user.
  - Description of your value proposition.
  - Your revenue stream comparison table.
  - An overview of your selected revenue model, including the different revenue streams you selected and how they work. Be sure to discuss why you chose these streams and how they relate to your venture's goals.
  - Details of your pricing strategy and sales forecasts.
  - Key assumptions that you are making in your model (e.g., freemium users will convert to paid users at X rate).
  - Key questions and milestones, i.e., what would you need to know and by when to validate this is the right revenue model for your product.
  - Revenue path that discusses how your revenue will grow over time.
