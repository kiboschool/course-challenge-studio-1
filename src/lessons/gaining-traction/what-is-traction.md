# What is Traction?

---

Imagine you make the best jollof rice and decide to start a business that makes it. Let’s call the business “Best Jollof.” You have bought your ingredients and opened an online store on Paystack's storefront to start selling this jollof rice to busy professionals during lunch. You’re excited. But there's a problem—Best Jollof’s online store has been live for one week, and no one is placing orders.

This happens in business. Without customers, even if your jollof (or whatever product you have to offer) is the best, the business might still not succeed. That's where "traction" comes in. Traction is like having a lot of orders for your jollof rice in your online store.

What is traction? According to the [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/traction) dictionary, *“Traction is the support or interest that is needed for something to make progress or succeed.”*

[Founder’s Institute](https://fi.co/insight/traction-growth-turning-your-startup-into-a-business) goes further to say that, *“Traction refers to the initial progress of a startup and the momentum it builds as it grows. When you have “traction,” you have a clear indicator that your product or service is viable, that you’ve found some level of product/market fit, you’re getting attention from your target audience, and you’re growing your brand.”*

Essentially, traction is the early evidence of demand that your product shows to demonstrate that it has the potential to succeed and to grow. It is the sign that shows that your product is good, people want it, and your product is well known. When Best Jollof gains traction, it means people are interested and buying what is available for sale.

**So, why is traction important?**

One of the top reasons businesses fail is because they don't have enough customers. Traction is the first few people happily buying your product. It shows your business is on the right track. Even before your product is ready, you need to think about how to get people interested and coming back for more.

You can break down traction into 3 key elements:

1. You have a **product your target customer likes**. Traction shows that your product is something people want.
2. Your target customer has demonstrated that they are **willing to pay** for this product.
3. Your target customer is **talking about your product to other people**, and you didn’t have to tell them to.
