## Venture Building Case Study Week 8 - Formalizing the Venture

As interest in EduBridge grows, the team recognizes the need to formalize their operations. They spend the week researching startup legal structures, intellectual property rights, and the basics of financial management. Kwasi takes the lead, translating complex legal and financial concepts into actionable plans, while the rest of the team contributes to defining roles and operational processes. This transition from an informal project to a structured venture is a critical step, teaching the team the importance of legal and financial planning in ensuring the sustainability and scalability of their social enterprise.
