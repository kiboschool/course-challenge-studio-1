Revenue streams are the cash a company generates from each customer segment. Revenue streams can include sales, subscription fees, leasing, and other means of generating income from the value propositions offered.

**Key Questions**:

- What are our customers really willing to pay for? And how much are they willing to pay for it?
- What and how do they currently pay for a similar service?
- How would they prefer to pay?
- How much does each revenue stream contribute to overall revenues?

**Tips**: Consider a variety of revenue streams such as asset sale, subscription fees, leasing, licensing, or advertising. Be creative but realistic about what your customers are willing to pay for.
