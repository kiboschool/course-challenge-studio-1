# Assignment - Business Model Canvas

---

**Task 1: Complete your business model canvas**
- Make a copy of this [business model canvas template](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/102mOZQmMxs0CslmNsPZ5KCNQwAIh9rh4baYgT0VWNAA/template/preview).
- Together with your team, fill out all the components for your venture. Make sure there is at least one entry for each business model canvas component.
- You can revisit the individual sections of this week's lesson for guidance on how to fill out components of the canvas. 

**Task 2: Interpret your business model canvas**
Once your team has completed the business model canvas, write an interpretation of your business model canvas. In the document, give detailed responses to the following questions:

- How did completing this business model canvas help you understand your venture better?
Why did you choose specific entries for each business model canvas component, and how does each entry contribute to the overall success of your venture? For example, if you identified subscription as your chosen revenue stream, share why and how you think it would make your venture successful. You must complete this for all nine components of the business model canvas.
- Based on your business model canvas, how feasible do you think your venture is, and what evidence do you have to support this?
- What challenges might you face with your venture, and how does your business model help you address these challenges?

This interpretation document should be between 500-750 words and should have an introduction and conclusion. 
Your submission would be assessed on the level of comprehensiveness, completeness, and thoroughness that goes into completing it.

## Submission
- All your submissions should use Google tools. Documents should be in Google Docs; the business model canvas should remain in Google Drawings.
- You should submit the link to your business model canvas and interpretation document on Gradescope and then upload a copy to Anchor.
