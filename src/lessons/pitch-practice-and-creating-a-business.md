## Venture Building Case Study Week 9 - Preparing to Pitch

The EduBridge team dedicates this week to preparing for their first major pitch to potential funders and partners. They collaboratively craft a narrative that highlights EduBridge's social impact, user feedback, and future potential. Rehearsing their pitch becomes a daily ritual, refining their messaging and delivery to make a compelling case for support. This preparation is not just about securing funding; it's a valuable exercise in storytelling, persuasion, and the art of communication, essential skills for any entrepreneur looking to make an impact.
