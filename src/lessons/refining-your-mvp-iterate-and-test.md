## Venture Building Case Study Week 6 - Iterating Based on Feedback

Armed with feedback from the pilot launch, the EduBridge team dives into refining their platform. They categorize feedback into actionable items, prioritizing issues that directly impact user experience. Amina tackles technical glitches, while Tolu rethinks navigation flows that confuse users. Brian revises lesson content for clarity and engagement, and Kwasi analyzes feedback for insights that could improve user retention. This week is a practical exercise in agility and problem-solving as the team iterates on their product, demonstrating the iterative nature of tech development and the importance of user feedback in driving product improvements.
