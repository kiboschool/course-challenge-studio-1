---

Your third final assessment for this course is the final product that you created.

You will need to submit to deliverables:

- Final Product link
- Demo video of the product


## Final Product Link

Please submit a link to a hosted version of your website where a user can test your product. Be sure to include test credentials.

## Demo Video of Product

Please submit a demo video of your product. The demo video should be 5 -1 0 long minutes and show the end-to-end flow of the product, from the home page to sign up and use of the product. If there are multiple user types (e.g., a marketplace that has different flows for buyers and sellers), the demo should show the perspective of both users.
