## Venture Building Case Study Week 2 - Aligning on Solutions

This week, the EduBridge team decides to step outside the campus and engage directly with their potential users to gather insights. They organize a series of informal focus groups with students and teachers in nearby schools, aiming to understand the educational challenges and needs firsthand.

Armed with notebooks and a set of open-ended questions, they initiate conversations about the students' daily learning experiences, the resources they currently use, and the obstacles they face. They sketch out ideas based on the feedback and consider the feasibility of incorporating these needs into the platform. Some team members focus on understanding the content and accessibility requirements from both a pedagogical and operational perspective.

The team regroups at the end of the week to share and analyze the insights they've collected. They find common themes and pain points among the feedback and start to align on a solution that addresses these core issues. This exercise not only brings them closer to a user-centered solution but also teaches them the value of empathy and active listening in the design process.
