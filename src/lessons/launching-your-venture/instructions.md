# Assignment Instructions

---

This week, your team should focus on launching your venture and continuing to test and iterate based on user feedback. As this is the mid-point of the term, your assignment for the week is an individual reflection on the venture-building process so far. 

There are 5 reflection questions in Gradescope that you are required to answer. Ensure that each of your answers is between 20 - 50 words.

The 5 reflection questions are:

- What is something unexpected you have learned about yourself so far this term?
- What is something unexpected you have learned from talking to users?
- What is something unexpected you have learned about entrepreneurship this term?
- What do you feel most uncomfortable about at this point?
- What are you eager to learn more about and practice during the second half of the term?
