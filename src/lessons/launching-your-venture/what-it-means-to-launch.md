# What it Means to Launch

---

Have you heard the saying, ‚ÄúIf a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?‚Äù

Imagine your new product as that tree, surrounded by other products and services that are competing for your customer‚Äôs attention. You've tirelessly nurtured your ‚Äútree,‚Äù making it into something you know is game-changing and impactful. All the hard work you've put into building this tree is now ready for the world to see and use.

Now, if this tree (your product) falls (goes live) and no one is there to hear about it, does it make a sound? Can your product make the impact you hope for if no one notices or uses it? 

For your product to truly make a difference, it needs an audience (People who will notice, appreciate, use, and spread the word about its benefits).

**This is what a product launch is all about: Ensuring your product gets the attention it deserves, is seen and used by the right people, and stands out in the crowded forest of options.**

## What is a Product Launch?

A product launch is the steps you take to introduce whatever you are working on to your target customer. It is the continuous effort you put in to ensure your customer knows about, and starts interested in, your product or service. The main goals of a product launch are:

- to create awareness,
- to have users, and
- to generate revenue.

<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);border-radius:2px;box-sizing:border-box;overflow:hidden;position:relative;width:100%;background:#F4F4F4"><iframe src="https://padlet.com/embed/wvr1k4l241xcz1vt" frameborder="0" allow="camera;microphone;geolocation" style="width:100%;height:708px;display:block;padding:0;margin:0"></iframe></div>

Apple is great at generating anticipation, excitement, and global attention for their product launches. They have teams dedicated to planning and executing on the launch. It helps that they are a trillion dollar company with a lot of resources to pull this off. 

Here are some of the things Apple does to have such successful launch events that you could learn from:

1. **Making sure the product works**. Before a product launch, Apple ensures that all products have been tested and are ready for use. They do this internally first, then with a small group of users and influencers.
2. **Planning in advance**. Apple is constantly releasing new products, showing that launching is not a one-time event (more on this in section 1.2 when we discuss types of launch). For example, every year, they release a new iPhone and host an event to showcase it. The dates for this event are usually fixed ‚Äì usually in the second week of September every year. Having a set date for their event means that they are planning in advance and not waiting till the last minute to launch.
3. **Building up anticipation**. Leading up to the launch event, Apple usually has teaser events that fuel curiosity and discussion, creating a buzz long before the actual event. This way, they get interest from people even before the product launches.
4. **Choosing the right channel and venue.** Apple often chooses memorable venues that reflect their values of design and innovation, like the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park. They also choose distribution channels like YouTube and Twitter for maximum reach.
5. **Demonstrating the product**. During the event, attendees and virtual viewers are given the opportunity for hands-on experiences with the new products. This hands-on approach reinforces Apple's commitment to delivering transformative experiences, allowing users to interact with the technology firsthand. It also allows users to know what new features are available and encourages them to use these features.
6. **Making the product available**. Apple's marketing strategy creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity. Products are made available shortly after the announcement, with pre-orders opening immediately or shortly after the event. This strategy taps into the excitement generated during the launch.
7. **Involving ambassadors and partners**. Apple involves developers, ambassadors and partners in its events. By taking advantage of the ecosystem, Apple is showing that they value collaboration. This also increases their chances of getting people to refer them to others.
8. **Collecting feedback and sharing updates after launch**. Even after the launch event, Apple remains engaged with its audience. The company provides regular software updates, addresses user feedback, and ensures a positive experience after selling, reinforcing its commitment to ongoing improvement.

## Why Does Launching Matter?

Launching a product is a crucial step for any company, and it's not just about showing off something new and cool. The importance of a product launch goes beyond the excitement of the moment. It's like throwing a big birthday party for your product, and here's why it matters so much:

1. **Creating awareness**. Imagine you've worked hard on a fantastic new board game. You want everyone to know about it and get excited. A launch is like turning on a spotlight, making sure people notice and start talking about your game. It's the way to shout, 'Hey, look at this amazing thing we've made!'
2. **Setting the stage for traction**. Let's go back to the board game example. You want people to not only know about your game but also buy it and enjoy playing. A well-planned launch generates interest and builds anticipation, making customers eager to get their hands on your product. It's like creating a buzz that turns into actual sales.
3. **Building credibility**. When a company confidently introduces a new product, it shows they believe in what they've created. It's like saying, 'We've put a lot of thought and effort into this, and we're proud of it.' This builds trust with customers and makes them more likely to choose your product over others.
4. **Getting user feedback**. Just like sharing a sneak peek of your game with friends before the big release, a product launch allows companies to see how people respond. Whether it's positive reviews, suggestions for improvement, or even concerns, this feedback is invaluable for making the product even better.

‚ö†Ô∏è Remember: Launching a product does not always have to be a flashy event; it's a strategic move that allows you to achieve the goals you are setting for your company so it can succeed. It's about creating a splash, sparking interest, and ultimately turning a great idea into a successful reality. So, when you launch a product, you're not just throwing a party ‚Äì you're setting the stage for your product to shine and thrive in the market.
