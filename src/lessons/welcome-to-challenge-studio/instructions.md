# Assignment Instructions

---

This week, you will need to meet with your group for a kickoff meeting and submit *two* assignments. Each group should go through the following process to complete the assignments comprehensively:

1. Schedule a team meeting for your first interaction.

2. During the meeting, you will:

   a) Discuss and establish team norms. Team norms are a set of agreed-upon rules and expectations that guide the team's behavior and interactions.

   b) Create or refine your problem statement. 

3. During the team meeting, you should make a copy of the [Team Charter Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wszG-uqw6S07W5fV4hWJaZ22rTn0dAnBpAq9QZxsCYk/template/preview) and assign someone to take notes in the document. This document should capture key points discussed during the meeting. Be sure to talk through all the questions listed in the charter and note down your answers. There is also a section in the team charter for general meeting notes so that you can document anything else that your team agrees on. You will need this information to complete the individual assignment for this week.

4. For the problem statement creation and refinement, you will be using the following [Problem Statement Definition Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ux-sk11z_A2iwHVu-xNh9nUjHjThxLBKNvJGT0Agba0/template/preview).

5. After the meeting, ensure all team members have access to the team charter and the problem statement definition documents.

6. Your group should continue refining your problem statement until you are all happy with it. You can do this by scheduling additional follow-up meetings or working asynchronously in the shared problem statement definition document. 

This week, you will be submitting **two** deliverables:
- Group Meeting Reflection
- Problem Statment

Continue on to the next two sections for more details on each of these assignments.
