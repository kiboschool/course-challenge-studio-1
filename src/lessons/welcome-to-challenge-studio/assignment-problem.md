# Assignment - Problem Statement

---

For this assignment, each group will submit the refined problem statement for your project. You should create a copy of the following template: [Problem Statement Definition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ux-sk11z_A2iwHVu-xNh9nUjHjThxLBKNvJGT0Agba0/template/preview)

The template walks you through the steps of defining your problem statement and includes a section where each team member should leave feedback on the draft statement. It also includes a section for the final problem statement that your group agrees on after taking all group members' feedback into consideration.

As you write and refine your problem statement, remember to keep it clear, concise, and focused.

## Submission

This is a group submission, so you only need to create one copy of the problem statement definition to submit on Gradescope. However, ensure that each group member submits the problem statement definition document on Anchor.
