# Refining Your Problem Statement

---

Every good venture starts with a problem. By this, we mean it starts with you building a solution to a problem people have. You spent most of your Engineering for Development (E4D) course learning how to analyze development problems and strong problem statements. To kick off Challenge Studio, you'll refine your problem statement together with your newly formed team to work on one statement that you all agree with. As a team, you can also choose to create a whole new problem statement that is different from what you worked on in E4D. 

> ðŸ“º Watch the following video to jog your memory on problem statements.

As you learned in E4D, remember that good problem statements are:

- **Clear**: The problem statement should be crystal clear, leaving no room for ambiguity. It should convey the issue in a straightforward and understandable manner.
- **Relevant**: The problem statement should be highly relevant to the research at hand. It must directly relate to the subject matter and research objectives.
- **Important**: Address the question of why the problem matters. Why should anyone care about this issue? Highlight its significance in the larger context.
- **Impactful**: Consider how solving this problem can make a difference in the world. What positive changes or contributions can your research bring about?

With your team members, review the following problem definition [template](https://mspguideorg.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/8msp_tools_problem_definition_worksheet_8.pdf).

</aside>

The questions in the above template are:

- What is the key issue you are trying to address, and why is it important?
- Who is it a problem for?
- What social or cultural factors shape this problem?
- What evidence do you have that this is worth the investment?
- Can you think of this problem in a different way? How can you reframe it?
