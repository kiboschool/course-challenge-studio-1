# Generating Ideas for User Needs

---

Now that you've  got a handle on how to understand what users need, it's time to shift gears and learn how to turn that understanding into solid business ideas. In this lesson, we're going to explore different ways to brainstorm and generate ideas. Think of this as your toolkit for coming up with the kind of ideas that make people go, "Why didn't I think of that?!" We're going to look at all sorts of ways to brainstorm and get those creative juices flowing.

Here are the questions mentioned in the video, as well as the examples of businesses whose products or services answer each question for a specific user and context:
- Is there an easier way? (e.g., HelloFresh)
- Can I make this more accessible? (e.g., Airbnb)
- What can I improve about this? (e.g., Uber)
- Is it time to pivot? (e.g., Netflix)

## Ideation 

While it is great to see how successful businesses have created solutions that answer the above questions, it's not clear how they did so. How did they go from an initial understanding of the challenges that users faced or the opportunities that might have existed (i.e., the output of the Empathize stage) to actually coming up with an idea that they can flesh out and start prototyping? 

> ðŸ“º Watch the following video on the Ideation stage of the design thinking process.

Some of the ideas presented in the video might seem a little abstract, so lets check back in with the EduBridge team to see how they are using the Ideation stage of the design thinking framework to make progress on building their venture. 

> **Checking-In with the EduBridge Team**
> 
>On a Tuesday afternoon in late April, the EduBridge team assembled over Zoom for their scheduled brainstorming session. Alongside the core members (Amina, Tolu, Brian, and Kwasi) were two local educators, Ms. Adhiambo and Mr. Okeke, who were invited to provide additional perspectives.
>
>Amina outlined the session's structure: a two-hour limit, a focus on generating a broad range of ideas without immediate critique, and an openness to unconventional suggestions. The team agreed, understanding the value of diverse and creative input in developing solutions.
>
>The whiteboard was quickly filled with notes and sketches. Tolu presented an idea for an app that could deliver educational content via SMS to areas with limited internet access. This concept sparked a lively discussion about accessibility and reach. Ms. Adhiambo suggested a model where both students and teachers could contribute to the platform's content, making it more relevant and engaging. Brian, inspired by this community-driven approach, proposed incorporating game-like elements to encourage participation. Kwasi, typically more grounded, surprised the group by suggesting the use of drones for material delivery to remote locations. This idea, while ambitious, highlighted the team's willingness to explore all possibilities. Building on the conversation, Mr. Okeke recommended a feature for the app that would allow students to connect and collaborate, simulating a classroom environment. This idea aligned with EduBridge's goal of fostering community and support among users.
>
>In the latter part of the session, Amina introduced constraints to challenge the team further, such as designing solutions with minimal cost. This led to creative suggestions like utilizing community radio infrastructure and creating paper-based learning kits enhanced with digital elements through QR codes.
>
>The session concluded with a reflective discussion, where each participant highlighted a favorite idea from the day, emphasizing the collaborative nature of the brainstorming process. The whiteboard, covered in a variety of ideas and concepts, stood as a testament to the session's productivity. The inclusion of external educators provided valuable insights, grounding the team's creative solutions in real-world educational needs.

## Boosting Creativity and Getting Unstuck

It would be great if all brainstorming sessions were as successful as the one described above. However, ideation can be challenging and frustrating more often than not. Remember that creativity is actually a process, as opposed to some innate natural skill. Employing useful techniques can help you get better at it. 

> ðŸ“º Watch the following video to learn techniques that can prepare you for ideation, help you create solutions, and unblock you when you get stuck.
