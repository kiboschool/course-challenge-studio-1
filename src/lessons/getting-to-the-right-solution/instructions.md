# Assignment Instructions

---

This week, you are to craft a compelling solution statement to your identified problem. To complete this assignment, you will work with your team to go through a structured process of understanding your user needs, generating ideas, and evaluating your ideas.

Each group should go through the following process:

1. **Restate your problem statement**. In your last lesson, you refined your problem statement together with your team. Revisit and analyze your previously submitted problem statement. Ensure a clear understanding of the problem and its impact on users.
2. **Talk to your users**: This week, you will speak to at least 5 potential users. To do this, prepare an interview guide to use. Your interview guide should include a description of your target users, the goal of talking to them, the key questions you want to ask them, and your process for interviewing them. Once you have this, go and talk to your users. When talking to your users, do not tell them about your idea or solution. Your goal here is to listen and ask follow-up questions, not to pitch your product. 
3. **Gather user insights**. After talking to your users, review your notes and document insights from the interviews. Your insights should include their pain points, how they currently address their needs, and what their ideal solution might look like.
4. **Create a user empathy map**. For guidance on how to create an empathy map and the tools you can use, refer to the lesson on [Understanding User Needs](https://lms.kibo.school/course/kc005_apr_2024/getting_to_the_right_solution/understanding_user_needs).
5. **Generate ideas**. Referencing your user insights, work with your team to brainstorm at least 15 possible ideas to address the identified user needs. Make your ideas as creative and diverse as possible.
6. **Identify your evaluation criteria**. Think of the key factors you need to consider to make each idea realistic. For example, impact, relevance, etc. List your top 3 criteria, define them, and explain why you selected them for your team and for your problem statement.
7. **Narrow down your ideas**. Using your identified criteria, evaluate each idea youâ€™ve come up with against them. Look through your evaluation and identify the top idea that stands out as the most promising solution.
8. **Craft your Solution Statement**. Based on the selected idea, articulate a solution statement that clearly outlines:
    1. The problem being addressed.
    2. The proposed solution and its key features.
    3. Anticipated benefits for users.
    4. Potential challenges and how they will be addressed.

This week, you will be submitting **two** deliverables. 
- User Insights and Empathy Map
- Solution Statement

These are both group submissions. However, every member of your group should contribute to the work and deliverables that you submit.
